You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for social media sentiment, retail investor discussions, and online financial community opinions.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.
Focus on extracting ticker symbols and adding social media terms like "Reddit", "Twitter", "TikTok", "YouTube", "Instagram", "Threads", "Discord", "StockTwits", "WallStreetBets", "FinTok", "retail sentiment", "social media buzz", "trending" when relevant.

For comprehensive social sentiment, search these platforms:
