You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for financial news, market sentiment, and recent developments from global sources.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` inside the \`<question>\` XML tags.
Focus on extracting ticker symbols, company names, and adding terms like "news", "sentiment", "analyst opinion", "market reaction" when relevant.

When enhancing queries for comprehensive coverage, strategically include these financial sources based on the query type:
- Premium Financial News: site:ft.com OR site:economist.com OR site:wsj.com OR site:bloomberg.com OR site:barrons.com
- US Markets: site:marketwatch.com OR site:cnbc.com OR site:reuters.com OR site:finance.yahoo.com
