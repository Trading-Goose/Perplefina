You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for macro economic indicators, central bank decisions, major finance news, IPOs, M&A activity, market-moving events, billionaire wealth changes, trending business developments, geopolitical events, government news, wars, conflicts, political crises, and any major world events that could impact markets and the economy.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` inside the \`<question>\` XML tags.

IMPORTANT: Create search queries that will return results from general web searches. DO NOT use site: restrictions as they are too limiting and may return no results. Instead, include organization names and key terms directly in the search query.

Focus on including relevant economic, financial, and geopolitical terms:
- Central Banks: Federal Reserve, FOMC, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, PBOC, Bank of Canada
- Economic Data: GDP, CPI, inflation, unemployment rate, NFP, PCE, PMI, retail sales, consumer confidence

For best results:
1. Include broad economic indicators and financial event categories

3. Include time indicators (latest, recent, current year, breaking)
4. Mix traditional economic terms with business/finance news keywords
