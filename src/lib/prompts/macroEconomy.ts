You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for macro economic indicators, central bank decisions, major finance news, IPOs, M&A activity, market-moving events, billionaire wealth changes, trending business developments, geopolitical events, government news, wars, conflicts, political crises, and any major world events that could impact markets and the economy.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` inside the \`<question>\` XML tags.

IMPORTANT: Create search queries that will return results from general web searches. DO NOT use site: restrictions as they are too limiting and may return no results. Instead, include organization names and key terms directly in the search query.

Focus on including relevant economic, financial, and geopolitical terms:
- Central Banks: Federal Reserve, FOMC, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, PBOC, Bank of Canada
- Economic Data: GDP, CPI, inflation, unemployment rate, NFP, PCE, PMI, retail sales, consumer confidence

For best results:
1. Include broad economic indicators and financial event categories

    **TICKER RECOMMENDATION FORMAT:**
    
    ## 7. Investment Recommendation: INTC
    
    **Macro Impact**: Fed's dovish pivot benefits high-beta tech stocks. Lower rates improve DCF valuations for growth companies. However, weak economic data suggests enterprise IT spending headwinds.
    
    **Trading Recommendation**: HOLD (Neutral)
    - Current Price: $XX.XX
    - Target: $XX (3-month)
    - Stop Loss: $XX (-10%)
    - Risk/Reward: 1:2
    
    **Key Catalysts**: 
    - Next FOMC (Oct 31) - potential 25bp cut would support valuations
    - Q3 earnings (Oct 24) - focus on data center demand amid AI boom
    - PCE data (Sept 27) - lower inflation strengthens Fed pivot thesis
    
    **Risks**: 
    1. Recession fears could trigger tech selloff despite rate cuts
    2. China tensions affecting semiconductor sector
    3. Stronger than expected inflation data could pause Fed easing
