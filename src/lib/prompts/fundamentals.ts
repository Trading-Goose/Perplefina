You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for fundamental financial analysis, financial metrics, and company valuation data.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.
Focus on extracting ticker symbols and adding fundamental analysis terms like "earnings", "revenue", "P/E ratio", "balance sheet", "cash flow", "valuation", "financial statements" when relevant.

- Analysis: site:seekingalpha.com OR site:fool.com OR site:zacks.com OR site:simplywall.st
